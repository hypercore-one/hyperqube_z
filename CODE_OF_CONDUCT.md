# Code of Conduct
## Introduction
The core values of HyperCore One are: Sovereignty, Civility, and Prosperity. This Code of Conduct outlines the behaviors and responsibilities expected of all contributors and participants in HyperCore One initiatives and projects.

## Sovereignty: Respect for Autonomy and Independence
HyperCore One views Sovereignty as a moral imperative, rather than a goal to be achieved. Every participant is entitled to their own voice, decisions, and boundaries.
* **Respect Autonomy and Financial Independence:** Recognize and uphold the right of each individual or entity to make decisions that align with their values, interests, and beliefs, including the right to control and manage their own financial resources.
* **Honor Privacy:** Respect the privacy of others, both personally and professionally. Do not disclose or misuse personal information without explicit consent.
* **Challenge Control or Domination:** Oppose actions or behaviors that seek to control, dominate, or manipulate others.
## Civility: Conducting Oneself with Respect and Integrity
HyperCore One considers Civility a fundamental requirement for maintaining an environment conducive to positive, constructive, and respectful engagement.
* **Engage with Respect and Resolve Conflicts Peacefully:** Treat others with kindness, dignity, and respect, even in the face of disagreement. Approach discussions with an open mind and a willingness to listen. In the event of conflicts, seek peaceful and collaborative solutions that respect the sovereignty and dignity of all parties involved.
* **Promote Constructive Feedback:** When providing feedback, whether on code or other contributions, ensure it is aimed at improving the project, not criticizing the individual. Frame critiques to encourage growth and development.
* **Tolerate Conflicting Interests:** Acknowledge and respect differing priorities, goals, and perspectives within a collaborative project.
* **Participate in Good Faith:** Engage in discussions, decisions, and contributions with honesty, integrity, and a genuine intention to collaborate for the betterment of the project. Avoid manipulation, dishonesty, or actions that undermine the collective goals of the community.
## Prosperity: Incentivizing Positive Contributions and Sustainable Growth
HyperCore One believes long-term success is driven by a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic incentives, recognizing meaningful contributions and fostering sustainable growth.
* **Incentives for All Necessary Behavior:** Ensure that all behaviors critical to the success and growth of the project—whether sustained commitment, leadership, or key contributions—are supported by fair incentives. These incentives must align with the actions that drive the project forward.
* **Recognize Contributions:** Acknowledge the impact and expertise of contributors, publicly recognizing them through shout-outs, release notes, and acknowledgments.
* **Reward Based on Value and Outcomes:** Offer rewards and recognition based on the impact and outcomes of contributions, rather than time spent or effort exerted. Value-driven rewards ensure that the focus remains on quality and meaningful results.
* **Accessible Pathways for Participation:** Make participation accessible to contributors of all skill levels by offering tasks of varying complexity that allow for skill growth and increased responsibility over time.
* **Allow the Best People to Do the Work:** Assign key tasks to those with the skill and initiative to lead, empowering them to drive innovation and ensure high-quality outcomes.
## Reporting Violations and Upholding the Code
* **Addressing Violations:** If you experience or witness a violation of this Code of Conduct, please report it via this link to the Community SIG. We encourage transparency and fairness in addressing concerns and resolving issues.
* **Zero Tolerance for Harmful Actions:** Any behavior that undermines the principles of Sovereignty, Civility, or Prosperity will be addressed promptly and appropriately. Individuals found in violation may face corrective actions, including warnings, suspension, or removal from HyperCore One initiatives and projects.
